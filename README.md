# Hackathon-Project-2022 - smart doctor.
Smart doctor is a system to unify rescue for representatives of service centers, the patient tells the representative what symptoms he feels, and the system finds out what medical problem he has, and returns what early medical treatment to give him - medicine / injection, etc.
A "smart doctor" also informs which car should be sent to the patient (ambulance / intensive care car).
